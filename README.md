`<search term>`: The word or letters being looked for - can look for all words with `kar` or for all words with `when`<br>
`language`: Specify the language to search through. Current options are `english` and `mandoa`<br>
`[-r]` or `root`: root - if specific term is wanted; such as `ad` but not `adiike`.<br>

**fandoa**<br>
Finds all words that contain the search term and prints the results to the current text channel. Accesses local fandoa file dictionary - NOT an existing google doc. NOTE: betens can be *any* single quotation mark!<br>

**fandoa_edit**<br>
Allows a user to edit the fandoa.json file- whether by writing a new definition, correcting misspellings. Additional editing features may be added in the future. Use `!fandoa_edit MANDOA_WORD LANGUAGE -REP Original_word New_word` ; where language is either the mandoa or english definition you wish to update and mandoa_word is the specific word you want to edit. -REP signals that you want to replace a part of the definition or term, and New_word is what you will be replacing the original with.

`!fandoa_edit MANDOA_WORD LANGUAGE TERM` is used when you want to replace the entire definition or term.
